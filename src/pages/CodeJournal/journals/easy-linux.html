          I've always been a big fan of learning Linux Command Line. Starting
          out with photography, I was always curious if there we're ways I could
          streamline tasks. Lately I've been digging for new ways that I can tap
          into Linux to return the information that I want. So, here's a few
          Linux Commands that I've found that make life a lot easier.
        </p>
        <h1 class="article-title mb-5">
          Search for all PID's with Webcam Access (MacOS)
        </h1>

        <pre class="article-code-snippet">
            sudo lsof | grep "AppleCamera\|iSight" | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u
        </pre>
        <p class="article-paragraph mt-5">
          This command will use lsof to list all open files, then filter the
          results to only show processes that have opened a webcam device file
          (either AppleCamera or iSight on macOS). The awk command will extract
          the second field (which is the PID) from the output, and the sort -u
          command will sort the PID's and remove duplicates.
        </p>
        <h1 class="article-title mb-5 mt-6">
          Iterate actions over multiple files by using "for"
        </h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph mt-5">
          This is a great method for instances when you need to perform actions
          over batches of files that would be otherwise cumbersome if performed
          individually.
        </p>
        <pre class="article-code-snippet mb-6">
          for file in *.txt; do 
          mv -- "$file" "${file%.txt}.text"
          done
          
          # Rename all *.txt to *.text
        </pre>
        <h1 class="article-title mb-5 mt-8">
          Check all IP's on the Current Network
        </h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph mt-5 mb-5">
          Joining a public network? This is a great way to see all of your
          compadres who are on the same network that you're connected to. Also,
          the address that's in position 0, is usually the IP address of the
          router itself. If you copy it and paste it into the browser, it will
          usually lead you right to the router login page, better known as the
          router management interface.
        </p>
        <pre class="article-code-snippet mt-5 mb-6">
            arp -a -ll
        </pre>
        <h1 class="article-title mb-5 mt-16">
          Transfer files from Local Directory to Remote Directory
        </h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph mt-5 mb-5">
          Who needs WebFTP when you can just use SSH?
        </p>
        <pre class="article-code-snippet">
          # transfer all files recursively from [local] to [remote destination]

            scp -r ./mylocalfolder/* myremoteusername@myserveraddress.com:~/destination/of-your-choice
